# Weather Data Pipeline to Snowflake

## Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a comprehensive data pipeline to collect, process, and store weather data for advanced analytics. The pipeline ingests raw weather data into MongoDB, transforms and cleans it using Python, and loads the processed data into Snowflake for efficient querying and analysis.

## Key Features
- **Data Ingestion**: Collects raw weather data from external sources (e.g., weather APIs) and stores it in a MongoDB NoSQL database for flexible storage.
- **Data Transformation**: Utilizes Python and pandas to extract data from MongoDB, clean it by removing unnecessary fields (e.g., `_id`), and structure it into analysis-ready DataFrames.
- **Data Storage**: Loads the cleaned and transformed data into Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehouse, enabling scalable and high-performance analytics.
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error management to handle connection issues, empty datasets, or data inconsistencies, ensuring pipeline reliability.
- **Automation**: Designed for scalability and automation, supporting large-scale weather data processing with efficient resource management.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for data extraction, transformation, and cleaning.
- **pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and transformation into structured formats.
- **pymongo**: For seamless interaction with MongoDB to retrieve raw weather data.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for initial storage of unstructured weather data.
- **Snowflake**: Cloud data warehouse for storing and analyzing processed data.
- **APIs (optional)**: Integration with weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) for real-time data collection.

## Achievements
- Built an end-to-end data pipeline that seamlessly integrates weather data from MongoDB to Snowflake, enabling advanced analytics and reporting.
- Demonstrated proficiency in data engineering by implementing a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process with Python and cloud technologies.
- Ensured data quality through cleaning and transformation, making the data suitable for business intelligence and forecasting applications.
- Optimized resource usage with proper MongoDB connection management and efficient data loading into Snowflake.

## Impact
This project highlights my expertise in designing scalable data pipelines for real-world applications. By leveraging MongoDB, Python, and Snowflake, I created a system that transforms raw weather data into a structured format ready for advanced analytics, such as weather trend analysis or predictive modeling. The pipelineâ€™s flexibility and robustness make it adaptable for integration with various data sources and analytics platforms.
